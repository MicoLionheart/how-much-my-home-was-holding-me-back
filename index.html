            <h2>1. Recognizing the Problem</h2>
            <h3>When Your Home No Longer Fits Your Life</h3>
            <p>For years, I didn’t realize how much my home was affecting my daily life. The layout felt cramped, the lighting was poor, and the lack of functional spaces made even simple tasks frustrating. It wasn’t until I started working from home that I truly understood how much my environment was holding me back.</p>
            <p>That’s when I decided it was time for a change—and I reached out to <a href="https://www.gobeyondbuilders.com/services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Builder’s Renovation Services</a> to help me transform my space.</p>
